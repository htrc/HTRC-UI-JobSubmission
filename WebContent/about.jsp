		<h4>
			<u>Overview</u>
		</h4>
		<p>The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) enables computational
			access for nonprofit and educational users to published works in the
			public domain and, in the future, on limited terms to works
			in-copyright from the HathiTrust.</p>
		<p>The HTRC is a collaborative research center launched jointly by
			Indiana University and the University of Illinois, along with the
			HathiTrust Digital Library, to help meet the technical challenges of
			dealing with massive amounts of digital text that researchers face by
			developing cutting-edge software tools and cyberinfrastructure to
			enable advanced computational access to the growing digital record of
			human knowledge.</p>
		<p>Leveraging data storage and computational infrastructure at
			Indiana University and the University of Illinois at
			Urbana-Champaign, the HTRC will provision a secure computational and
			data environment for scholars to perform research using the
			HathiTrust Digital Library. The center will break new ground in the
			areas of text mining and non-consumptive research, allowing scholars
			to fully utilize content of the HathiTrust Library while preventing
			intellectual property misuse within the confines of current U.S.
			copyright law.</p>
